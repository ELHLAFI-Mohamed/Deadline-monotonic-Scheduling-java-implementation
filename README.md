# Deadline-monotonic-Scheduling-java-implementation

In this repository we w'll show a simple implementation of Deadline-monotonic Scheduling algorithm using java programming language .

# lets start by asking the main question : what is Deadline-monotonic Scheduling :

Deadline Monotonic Scheduling :
It is a fixed priority based algorithm in which priorities are assigned to each task based on their relative deadline. Task with shortest deadline is assigned highest priority.
It is a Preemptive Scheduling Algorithm that means if any task of higher priority comes then, running task is preempted and higher priority task is assigned to CPU.
Priority of task is inversely proportional to deadline i.e., task with shortest deadline is assigned highest priority. Deadline is time limit in which task has to be completed.

Task can be represented as shown in figure :
